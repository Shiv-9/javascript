Javascript is single threaded , synchronous i.e each operation waits for the last one to 
complete before executing.

Code is of two type :-

Blocking code :- it blocks or stops the flow of code untill a operation is completed.
                 Read file sync.

Non Blocking code :- it does not block the execution of code i.e other operations are 
                     executed meanwhile a certain operation is executing on the side.
                      Read File Async.


Both Blocking as well as Non Blocking code are used according to the usecase no one is better than other. 


Now look as the diagram for refernce.

Different calls are made from the call stack to the web API where there is a Register call back .
 Register call back --> it stores the calls and events and when the execution is to be done it inserts 
                        the call back into the Task Queue from which the result it inserted insert the
                        call stack. 

 fetch also works the same way as register  but it uses the concept of promises which results in a high priority queue, i.e it is executed imeediately when received.
